# generating_data
A "Python Crash Course" Project

### *Intro to Packages*
This Project is my introduction to using packages in python. Specifically, 
I will be using Matplotlib, and Plotly to generate visual representations 
of data in different formats to learn about what tools to use, and when to 
use them.

### *Intro to Creating Classes in Python*
This project will also serve to help me learn about using creating classes
in Python, and planning for larger scale uses of code. I will learn how 
to utilize OOP principles like polymorphism, class aggregation, and encapsulation.


#### Thanks So Much for Viewing!
